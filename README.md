This repository contains a deep learning-based solution for object detection and classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset. The project includes model training, evaluation, and inference scripts.




## Requirements

To set up the project, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

1. **Training**:
   - Open the `ciphar_10_.ipynb` notebook to train the model or use the `model.py` script.
   - The trained model weights are saved as `resnet_model.pth`.

2. **Inference**:
   - Run the `app.py` script to perform inference on new images:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```

## Dataset

The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, such as airplanes, cars, birds, and cats. The class names are listed in `class_names.txt`.

## Model

The project uses a ResNet-based deep learning model for classification. The pretrained weights are stored in `resnet_model.pth`.
